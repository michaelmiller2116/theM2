  <p>This wonderful silicone sponge is designed to take care of your favorite non-stick pans and pots. It's sturdy bristles guarantee a scratch free experience while offering great multipurpose performance when cleaning your dishes, veggies and/or fruit. This sponge is also great to handle hot pots and pans. There are a lot of silicone sponges on the market, however, the silicone sponges from TheM2 Limited offer several improvements that differentiate them from the rest</p>
  <p>There are several studies from reputable publications that talk about the problem of bacteria in traditional sponges and how hard it is to eliminate it. Silicone sponges offer an easy solution to that issue. These kind of sponges are durable and made of a material that doesn’t collect bacteria. Also, it’s bristles are strategically located to ensure an easy clean and guarantee no food left over.</p>
  <p>Our Sponges are sold in a package of three different colors: green, red and blue. Different colors will help you differentiate it's purpose (e.g, green for veggies; blue for counters; red for dishes.)
Our sponges are slightly smaller than the competition. Most of the sponges on the market are bigger than your hand and does not offer that essential grip that you need for a comfortable and secure cleaning experience.</p>
<p>This silicone sponge not only offers and ergonomic design that adapts to your hand but, also, includes a back strap and wavy texture that will guarantee a perfect grip and a comfortable fit while cleaning. We, as parents, were concerned about bacteria and possible infections brought from it, so we gave it a try before putting it on the market and we absolutely loved the experience.
We made the change and now we can’t go back to smelly (and gross) traditional ones!</p>
